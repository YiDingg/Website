# MyNotesStructure

My notes, blogs, project documents are based on Notability, Markdown and Latex. 
Some notes that need a lot of colorful pictures are taken by Markdown+HTML on VSCode+Typora, and they will be displayed as blogs in the column "Blogs". 
Some notes that need numerous formula to derive the conclusions are taken by Latex on VSCode, displayed in PDF format. 
The rest will be written on Notability, displayed in PDF format.
