# Home Page

## Intro

This is an awesome, ready-to-use website based on docsify, deployed on GitHUb Pages. It is separated from [my original website](https://yidingg.github.io/YiDingg) and modified to be an example for you. You can simply fork it into your repo to have the same website or modify it to fit your thoughts. Visit [Home Page](https://yidingg.github.io/WebsiteExample/#/HOMEPAGE) to see what's this site like, refer to [Syntax 20Examples](https://yidingg.github.io/WebsiteExample/#/Blogs/SiteFeatures/Syntax%20Examples) for it's rich features and components, and go to [GitHub](https://github.com/YiDingg/WebsiteExample) to fork or clone it. 

You can refer to [Build Your Personal Website](https://yidingg.github.io/YiDingg/#/Blogs/Mixed/BuildYourSite) to learn how to build your own website using docsify, or for more information.
